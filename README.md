# Currency-Converter

## Project Brief

### MVP - Minimum Viable Product

- Use 3rd party API and Airtable

Calling an API and displaying the data for the user. You may use any API of your choosing or Find an available API here
You must use Airtable (but NOT the airtable client) to store data.
- Use React framework to build your application with at least

5 components
4 props
2 useStates
2 react router routes
1 lifting state, which is used to implement CRUD on the client side

- Be styled such that the app looks and feels similar to apps we use on a daily basis - in other words, it should have a consistent and polished user interface.

- Be deployed online (Vercel).

- Have full-CRUD single model operations somewhere within the app's features. For example, you can have functionality that Creates & Updates & Delete by implementing the ability to CRUD favourites.

## App Description (About Page)

An application for users who frequently travels overseas and needs to manage different currencies. 
This application is a currency converter which quickly and easily convert between 
different currencies at the current exchange rates. Our wallet function allows users to 
keep track of their existing currencies they possess. This will help users make informed 
financial decisions and ensure they have a clear understanding of the value of their money 
in different countries. In addition, users can use the application to get a better 
understanding of how the foreign currencies has been fluctuating via the charts.

## Key Challenges

One of the challenges I faced was really trying to get everything to connect. Also using AirTable to do CRUD is relatively challenging but a good experience nonetheless.

## Future Features

- Make the wallet cater to different users.
- More percentage features.
- Adding business news related to the currencies.
